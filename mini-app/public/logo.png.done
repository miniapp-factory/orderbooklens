A stylized representation of a financial order book with a heatmap overlay. The background is a subtle gradient from dark blue at the top to light blue at the bottom. In the center, a white circle marks the mid‑price. Vertical bars represent price levels; larger bars are in darker red hues to indicate larger resting orders, while smaller bars are lighter. A faint grid overlay provides reference lines, and a translucent heatmap gradient (from green to red) overlays the bars to show liquidity density. The overall composition conveys depth, intensity, and real‑time data flow.
