```
Idea: A visual order book and liquidity heatmap.
User goal: Quickly see where major liquidity clusters and walls are.
Core features (MVP):

* Real-time order book depth (bids/asks).
* Cumulative depth chart (classic depth graph).
* Price levels with highlighted “walls” (large resting orders).
* Configurable depth range (e.g., ±1%, ±3%, ±5% from mid-price).

Development plan:

1. Connect to an exchange’s order book WebSocket API.
2. Aggregate levels and compute cumulative volume.
3. Render:

a depth chart (using a chart library),
a list of top N levels with color intensity by size.


4. Add user controls: pair selection, depth range, minimum wall size.
5. Optimize throttling/batching of updates so the UI stays smooth.
```

Generate an app logo and update the app metadata title and description.

#### Generate an app logo and update the app metadata title and description.  

The changes you’ll need to make are in the following files:

- `mini-app/lib/metadata.ts` – update the `title` and `description` exported values.  
- `mini-app/public/logo.png.todo` – create a new `.todo` file that describes the logo image you want to generate.  

These are the only files that must be edited to satisfy the request to generate an app logo and update the app metadata title and description.

A stylized representation of a financial order book with a heatmap overlay. The background is a subtle gradient from dark blue at the top to light blue at the bottom. In the center, a white circle marks the mid‑price. Vertical bars represent price levels; larger bars are in darker red hues to indicate larger resting orders, while smaller bars are lighter. A faint grid overlay provides reference lines, and a translucent heatmap gradient (from green to red) overlays the bars to show liquidity density. The overall composition conveys depth, intensity, and real‑time data flow.
