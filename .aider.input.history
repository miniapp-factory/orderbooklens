+Code the following app
+```
+Idea: A visual order book and liquidity heatmap.
+User goal: Quickly see where major liquidity clusters and walls are.
+Core features (MVP):
+
+* Real-time order book depth (bids/asks).
+* Cumulative depth chart (classic depth graph).
+* Price levels with highlighted “walls” (large resting orders).
+* Configurable depth range (e.g., ±1%, ±3%, ±5% from mid-price).
+
+Development plan:
+
+1. Connect to an exchange’s order book WebSocket API.
+2. Aggregate levels and compute cumulative volume.
+3. Render:
+
+a depth chart (using a chart library),
+a list of top N levels with color intensity by size.
+
+
+4. Add user controls: pair selection, depth range, minimum wall size.
+5. Optimize throttling/batching of updates so the UI stays smooth.
+```
+
+Generate an app logo and update the app metadata title and description.
